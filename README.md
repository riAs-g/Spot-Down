# Spotify Download Automation

This python script helps the user export the URLs of and download all songs from their Liked Songs playlist from the website [Spotmate](https://spotmate.online/en) using Selenium automation with Firefox's Geckodriver. In this script we have also used uBlock Origin extension addon since popups and ads can hinder with the automation process.
